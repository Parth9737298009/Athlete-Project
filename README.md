# Athlete-Project

# Sports Clustering Project
##Overview
This project uses K-Means clustering to group sports based on the physical attributes (height, weight, age) of their athletes. Additionally, logistic regression is employed to predict the likelihood of winning a medal based on these attributes. The project aims to provide insights into how different sports cluster together and how athletes' physical characteristics can influence their performance.

## Key Features
- Data Preparation: Cleaning and filtering the dataset to include relevant features and handle missing values.
- Standardization: Normalizing the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.
- Clustering: Applying K-Means clustering to group sports based on athletes' physical attributes.
- Visualization: Creating scatter plots to visualize clusters and understand groupings better.
- Regression Analysis: Using logistic regression to predict the likelihood of winning a medal based on age, height, weight, and gender.
## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing K-Means clustering and logistic regression.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations and plots.
- Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization.
